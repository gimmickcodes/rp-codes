            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <b>Cool-headed and savvy</b>, here's a guy who rose from petty thief to crime boss using little more than the strength of his wits. It helped that the previous head was his brother, but following their untimely death, not only did he step into the power vacuum, he also had to keep the spot. Became a vessel around the same time.

            (<a href="https://burnthesoul.jcink.net/index.php?showforum=28">See here for more on the Gallery Syndicate</a>)
            <br><br>
            He’s been on the streets since he was ten years old, with no one to rely on but himself, his brother, and what family they found in the form of other street kids. When he was 14, they were only pulled further into the city’s crime scene by people wanting to exploit his brother’s magic. Growing up in such an environment, he’s always had a keen awareness of the gap between haves and have-nots — money, status, magic.
            <br><br>
            It’s shaped his value system into that of a <b>misanthropic Robin Hood with <I>very</I> amorphous morals</b>. However disdainful he is of the well-off, the privileged, the corrupt; however much he might sympathize with those who <I>aren’t</I>, he’s far from a saint. Case in point? He killed his brother because he disagreed with the way they ran things.
            <br><br>
            As a person, he’s <b>conversational</b> and easy to get along with if you don’t mind a <b>cuttingly dry wit</b>. Not warm, but genial. <b>Genial, but impersonal</b>. Friendly acquaintances may therefore be numerous, but close confidantes are rare and often one-sided. As likely to unlose his temper as he is to laugh, there are <b>few things that can get under his skin</b>, be it a gruesome murder or a harsh insult — just don’t be surprised when he responds in kind. <br><br>


            <h2>Assorted Plot Hooks</h2>
            <b>•</b> Controls a number of bars, casinos, night life, and frequents them fairly often. Maybe you’re a regular, work at one of them, want to book one of them or run into him randomly.<br><br>
            <b>•</b> Friends or partners in Eden — he fully supports Eden's cause, and tries to be on friendly terms with them so as to gather trust. That he also happens to want to kill off vessels using the Phoenix's power, or kill off those who seem attractive to the Phoenix (less competition) is something he keeps very secret. Could pave the way for betrayal plots down the line <br><br>
            <b>•</b> He’s always willing to offer “odd jobs” to people who need it, no criminal involvement or gang membership necessary. They’re mostly legal, and it’s mostly a way for him to collect favors and connections. Will also pay for information and useful gossip <br><br>
            <b>•</b> Flip side, hit him up if you need something illegal done. <br><br>
            <b>•</b> Potential allies who don't like vessels for whatever reason — maybe they hate magic, maybe they're afraid, maybe they think they're too dangerous. Whatever it is, if he senses it he'll try to recruit you <br><br>
            <b>•</b> Fellow criminals, former allies, partners or rivals: could be past or current members of the Gallery; could be they've worked together before he took charge. Depending on how long they’ve known each other, it might be a surprise to them that he’s now a vessel. <br><br>
            <b>•</b> Reunions with childhood friends, kids he knew growing up before he was orphaned, or else other orphans he met on the street.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            Raised by a middle class, single father determined to make a star out of him, he got his professional start as a child actor in theater and on TV. It wasn’t until after puberty, when he grew out of many previous roles, and devoted himself to making music that he became truly famous. Stardom wasn’t something Jesper actively aspired for, but it found him anyway when his debut album landed him at the top of the charts. Frontman of a famous band with several tours and platinum records under their belt, his is a widely recognizable face . (<a href="URLHERE">See here for more on his band</a>) <br><br>

            He became Orpheus’s vessel at 20 shortly after the death of his childhood sweetheart, and the combination of grief, an equally depressive spirit, and a creative crisis was not one he handled well. That said, Jesper’s garnered a reputation in recent years for being a <b>bad boy with self-destructive tendencies</b>. <br><br>

            In private, Jesper is <b>lackadaisical and unambitious</b>. He takes things as they come, fame included, seeing it as no more than a byproduct of his love for performing. At the same time, he’s <b>moody and unsubtle</b>, harboring little patience for putting on airs or beating around the bush. He can come across as hot-tempered, but his <b>bark is worse than his bite</b> and he <b>wears his heart on his sleeve</b>.



            <h2>Assorted Plot Hooks</h2>
            <b>•</b> Fans, stalkers, tabloid reporters.
            <br><br> <b>•</b> Fellow celebs, singers, actors. Could be past collaborators or simply acquainted by fame. While he’s primarily a singer, he also stars in the occasional movie from time to time.
            <br><br> <b>•</b> Concerned friends worried about his drinking and drugging.
            <br><br> <b>•</b> And the flip side, “friends” who enable, even encourage, his bad habits.
            <br><br> <b>•</b> Flings. No strings attached, no commitment. He has few standards beyond him being drunk and/or high and them being willing. Potential for it becoming something more.
            <br><br> <b>•</b> Simultaneously starved for a realer connection and terrified of finding and losing it yet again, he often pushes people away and assumes other parties are only interested in his status. When he does fall, he falls <I>hard</I> and is the clingy type.
