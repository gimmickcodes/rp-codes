We ask that you pick one ability, not an element that can do multiple things (ie manipulate fire in a certain way, not manipulate fire in general.) Please follow the template below as well for a guideline. Delete the irrelevant questions, and please answer each question properly. 01. Specify the ability and what it can do. 02. Specify the weakness of said ability. 03. Talk about the conditions in which ability can be used. 04. What can your character do (that they normally cannot do) when they are pushed to their limit with this ability? 05. What are the repercussions of them pushing themselves to their limits? 06. Finally, if your character is an Ayakashi, what is their (weaker) ability now that humans no longer believe in Ayakashis? 07. If your character is a Mononoke, what are the stronger side effects of using their ability now that they no longer need humans to believe in their existence? 08. If your character is Shaman, what exactly is the artifact that you want them to use for their relic?</td>
