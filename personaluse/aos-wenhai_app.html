         <h1 id="01">prelude for a straying star</h1>
         <paragraph>How to explain the gap between you and your elders. How, but as a do-over, redemption for a child in whom magic did not stir. Or perhaps you’re an accident, unsought for, unplanned for, and in time born prematurely, taking your mother’s life in the process. You hear growing up of how your father once had warmth; he buried it with her, and you feel its absence every time he passes you, eyes more remote than those stars they raise you to behold. <br><br>
            When your Gate opens, it opens on a straight path—a path to the heavens, where <i>approval</i> surely waits from the parent you long to impress. <i>Work hard,</i> they tell you; you’ll reach him in the end. You embrace their lessons eagerly, anxious to catch up to impressive older siblings, to he who never sees you. <br><br><i>Work hard,</i> you think, and you’ll be able to justify your life.<br><br>
            So, you rush on—except death travels faster. <br><br>

            All at once you’re a star with no orbit: no father to please, no mother to worry. Only prestige lost and sisters who leave, brothers too distant. You always were last, but as attention shifts to cousins, now you’re least too, with nothing to look forward to than being one more Zhang; one more archivist in the ranks of many. Talent and legacy, censure and coaxing—these become the forces that keep you moving forward, however halfhearted your steps.<br><br>

            It’s while you’re trudging that you meet <i>it</i> yet again: a shoulder bumped in the street; a killing intent, startling in its clarity, shocking to a mind that knew it only by its fruit. It isn’t meant for you, a stranger, but you remember. You follow a would-be murderer. And this time you outpace death. <br><br>

            You were a star with no orbit but instead of burning out, you've found yourself new kindling.</paragraph>

         <h2>Persona</h2>
         <blockquote><i>From afar:</i> Grew up outside the scrutiny received by older siblings and away from the pressure of being the (new) exarch’s issue, and at the same time far enough apart for the care of attendants and tutors to be largely undivided. Family therefore served as the touchstone for high and self-imposed expectations, but only in the realm of capability. In bearing, he stands apart for a lack of noble airs, youthful unpretentions never ironed out by the weight of political judgment, in fact embedded deeper for his familiarity with servants.
            <br><br>

            <i>Up close:</i> Righteous. Keenly aware of the moods of those around him. His attention is prone to moving, but in the manner of a spy glass searching the horizon—quick in its scans, yet settling with single-minded focus. Equal parts earnest and moody, dutiful and defiant, intense and flighty, he’s ambitious only in pursuit of courses charted by himself. Critics will find him dismissive, stubborn. A spitfire not easily derailed.
         </blockquote>

         <br>
         <h2>Activities</h2>
         <blockquote>An unenthusiastic student in his teenage years, coasting on raw talent as he went through the motions of what was expected. This changed following an incident a few years ago, from which he emerged newly invigorated. Of particular interest to him since then is a more actionable kind of divination: sifting through the future at micro scale, the level of people and intentions, in search of fates that can be forestalled.
            <br><br>

            Certified at the age 17. A long time apprentice in the archives, assisting with menial tasks and shadowing veteran star readers. He was officially inducted as a star scryer in the past year, shortly after reaching chisu. <br><br>

            Of late, he’s been shirking assigned duties despite spending no less time in the observatory. When he’s not there, he's out in the city and somehow always caught up in trouble that breaks out—almost as if he saw it coming. An increasingly familiar face for city peacekeepers as he takes it upon himself to track down would-be wrongdoers.

         <paragraph>Attained chisu within the past year. While his grasp of it is sufficient to operate star reading facilities, it remains impractical to use in most other contexts on account of the time and complete concentration required, and him having to remain stationary when attempting it. The exception is when there’s rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation, the heavier the better.<br><br> </paragraph>

         <h2>Mirror Gravure</h2>
         <blockquote>Where there is water, there is mirror to catch all light. He can enchant small bodies of water or form bubbles to capture all that is reflected on its surface. These reflections can be utilized in one of three ways: ‘streamed’ to a corresponding bubble as through a live feed; recorded and transferred to himself or others in the form of energy; or condensed into unmelting ice crystals for safekeeping. Stored in this way, anyone can extract and view their contents if they’re aware of their nature and capable of ryusu. While there’s no limit to how often recordings can be replayed, their contents aren't currently replicable. If returned to a liquid state, they can also be destroyed in all the ways you’d expect of a water-based storage medium—consumed, poured out, evaporated, etc. Audio is captured but can be difficult to parse, sounding as though filtered through water. </blockquote>
         <br>

         <h2>Interior Flow</h2>
         <blockquote>Long attuned to the moisture of his surroundings, at the most general level, he can perceive the presence and position of living bodies near him through their water content. Upon these he can peer deeper, gleaning from the movement of that water, of blood, the subjects’ emotions state and discerning vague intentions. These impressions grow indistinct the farther and more numerous his targets are. Conversely, with sufficient proximity he can detect deception by reading their pulse, though the concentration required limits him to one person at a time. <br><br>
            Finally, by making direct contact with a water sample from a target, he can divine the circumstances when it was produced. For example, with blood from a wound he can “see” the moment when injury happened, sense the emotions felt. Occasionally he might get flashes of the immediate future—not <i>prophecy</i> per se, but what the target sees themself doing. The amount of information gleaned is dependent on quantity and freshness of the sample, and cannot be performed on dried mediums. </blockquote>

         <br>
         <h2>Heavenly Witness</h2>
         <blockquote>Memories of the past and present are one and the same, for what is the latter but the shifting of indefinite future into definite past? What is the future but memories to be? His standard magic uses water to capture what <i>is</i>; by incorporating the divinatory power of the stars, he can capture what <i>was</i> and <i>will</i> be. In short, clairvoyance. From a sample of water, often one of his recordings, he can conjure visions pertaining to the area or person from which it was taken. As with mirror gravure, these visions can also be sealed into small ice slabs for later viewing. <br><br>
            At his beginner's level of chisu he is only able to gather the necessary astral energy through prolonged meditation below the night sky, or with the use of the Cheonbu-gwan’s astrolabes to help focus it for him. Since visions of scenes already occurred are indistinguishable from those that have not, proper identification relies on clues from the vision itself or cross-referencing it with star movements—a painstaking process even by star reading standards, given their narrow focus compared to, for example, weather events that affect all Daeho.<br><br>
