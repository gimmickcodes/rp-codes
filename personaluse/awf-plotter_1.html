            <div class="quartzplotter-h1">Carsyn Valentia</div>
            <div class="quartzplotter-h2">20-years old. Single. Demi. Eklekta of Thesphilia</div>
        </div>

    <div class="quartzplotter-main">
        Adopted into the Valentia family at 7, Carsyn is a recent Aegis graduate and military private. He often goes on missions to the Outside as a support role, and also works with the investigations team.<br><br>
        In conversation, he's neither shy nor a loner, but he doesn't actively seek out company. Reserved. Long-suffering. Seemingly impossible to anger. Occasionally blunt, but conflict avoidant. A bit of a pushover. With those he's comfortable with, he has a deadpan humor and slight snarky streak. Is altrusitic, passive aggressive, and prone to worrying. Professionally, he's dutiful to T, but has a tendency to disappear to his own devices when not on duty.<br><br>

        <b>History:</b> Born in Stelaris, Carsyn was the second child of a family of crooks who couldn't afford it. An unplanned kid, his parents would have given him up from the start were it not for two things: one, his seal; and two, the generous compensation Cyphun families were known to provide in exchange for promising eklektas. From then on, their plan was to wait for his powers to pronounce themselves, and then leverage it as best they could to drive up the price.
        <br><br>

        Present day, Carsyn's taken it to heart that most people—his parents, the Valentias, the army—only want him for what he can <i>do</i>. He's fixated on the idea of being "useful", desperate to be needed in lieu of being liked, and clings to anyone who offers validation outside of that—<i>after</i> he overcomes his initial skepticism. <br><br>

        <div class="quartzplotter-inset"><b>Hobbies:</b> Wandering around on foot, napping, sketching from life, daydreaming about traveling beyond Absolia, reading about the Old World.

        <!-- They made no secret of these intentions and impressed it upon him that it was his responsibility to pay them back. -->

        <div class="quartzplotter-h3">Plot Hooks</div>

        <ul class="quartzplotter-hooks">
            <li><b>Military</b> – Superiors, mentors, coworkers, fellow investigators. People who look down on him for not being as strong a fighter as he ought to be for a Valentia. People who exploit his ability to boost abilities, share elemental magic, or anchor them to life. Accompanies dangerous missions and helps out medics a lot for the same reason.</li>

            <li><b>Field partners</b> – Reluctant ones, long-time ones. His ability is maximized with people he’s practiced pooling abilities with, so it’s likely there’s a couple he gets repeatedly paired up with. Maybe they were friends in school, or become friends throughout the course of work. Could also be a hateship who work together well despite it all—think it'd be fun/angsty if someone was a feral berserker type who goes ham cause they know they can't die when Syn is there <s>nvm that he'd feel everything they do</s></li>

            <li><b>Former classmates</b> – He was in the a academy for 3.5 years and only graduated last year, so chances are high that he'd know most of the current cadets. Studious and generally well-behaved despite a tendency to get pulled into other people's escapades </li>

            <li><b>Friends</b> – Acquintances from the academy, kids from the other big families that he's known for longer. Fellow quiet types to vibe with. Adventurous types to drag him into hijinks and misadventures, who try and get him to lighten up. He's not naturally a troublemaker, and will complain and be quietly disapproving the whole way, but he relents easily and knows how to keep a secret. </li>

            <li><b>Martyr complex </b> – As said, his self-worth is tied up in being useful, to the point of self-destruction. Would love for people to either exacerbate this, confront him about it, or just push him to be more rebellious about pursuing his own wants.</li>

            <li><b>Valentia Family</b> – Grateful to the family for taking him in and tries his best to live up their and others’ expectations, often at the cost of what he actually wants. Is largely motivated by a need to prove their investment in him wasn’t a mistake. Very aware of the fact that the Valentias don't often adopt, and that it was the nature of his magic that drew them. Has niggling feeling that he’s more disposable compared to those born into the family, though he keeps such thoughts secret from the rest of the family. Is more formal with his parents, but familial with his siblings. </li>

            <li><b>Stelaris</b> – He spends a fair amount of time going there to track down suspects. Also has an ability which helps track people through objects they own. Maybe he followed the wrong item and you're innocent, or maybe you want to use him as a hunting dog. Also, outside of official missions, he used to use missions as pretense to try to find out what happened to his biological family. Maybe meets people that way while asking around. Others: people who know him from before he was adopted, people who knew his criminal parents.</li>

            <li><b>Crush</b> – Nothing endgame, but could be fun, be it mutual or one-sided. He would never admit it though.</li>

            <li><b>Misc</b> – Has an interest in studying the outside world and field research; maybe researchers for him to hover around and ask questions. I'm open to most anything, so feel free to reach out if you want to do anything not mentioned here either!</li>
