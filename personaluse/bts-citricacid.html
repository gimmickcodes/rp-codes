            <h1><i>Tripping on</i> <br>Citric Acid</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="main">
            Citric Acid, Citric for short, formed 10 years ago as a one-man band consisting of a 16-year old Jesper Martel and irregular collaborations with friends. Starting with a few self produced singles, its debut album made waves in the music scene and quickly scaled the charts. Its success, and that of later releases, captured the attention of top record labels and laid the groundwork for its rapid rise to fame.

            <br><br>Though a solo act to start, new members would be personally recruited in its early years. Now internationally famous, they have several tours and platinum records under their belt.

            <br><br>From 2064 to 2067, Citric would be plagued by a string of scandals as its leader, Jesper, ran afoul of substance use and intoxication laws. The final straw came three years ago when he was too wasted to perform a concert — this after other occasions where he'd appeared on stage blatantly inebriated — and Citric was dropped by their longtime record label. Jesper himself announced he was going on hiatus, though insiders claimed he had in fact been kicked out of the band.

            <br><br>Thus began a two year dry period as Citric Acid tried to re-establish themselves without their longtime front man. Though still widely recognized, labels were hesitant to align themselves and gigs were limited.

            <br><br>One year ago, NEST approached the band. They hoped to capitalize on Citric's name recognition and the possibility of a comeback story, and offered to take them on on the condition that its former leader and chief headliner returned.The band is generally tight knit, though personality differences and conflicts may exist between members.

            <br><br>Additional info:

            <ul>
                <li>Their music is a mix of pop, rock, R&B, alternative.</li>

                <li>Members have been in the group for <b>at least 5 years, max 9</b>. There is potential for one person with a tenure of only 3 years, having been recruited while Jes was on hiatus.</li>
                <li>Members should be <b>23 to 28-years old</b>.</li>
                <li>Other than the above requirements, personalities, face claims, relationships, instrument(s), guild, vessel/civilian, etc. are entirely open.</li>
            </ul>
