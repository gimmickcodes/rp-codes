            <blockquote>
               <b>Jikoku's Gate</b> [SUB-SKILL] - He can summon spirits by opening a gate between the material and spiritual planes. In their base form they appear as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sZWzwE0.gif">black, cloud-like entities</a> but can condense into the shape of shadowy animals. Purifying magic can forcefully dispel them, after which there is an 3-post (15-minute) cool down before they can be resummoned.
               <br><br>

               <b>Interior Gate</b> [SUB-SKILL] - He draws the same energy from the other plane directly into himself. This aura can then be channeled into blows or weapons to enforce them or extend his reach. Lasts 5 posts. Shares a 3-post cool down with <b>Jikoku's Gate</b> — neither one can be used immediately after the other

            </blockquote>

            <b class="h6">Pathmaker</b><br>
            <blockquote>
               <b>Ingress</b> [SUB-SKILL] - Opens a passage through any surface he's touching, rendering a part intangible. Only one pathway can be made at a time, spanning 3 by 3 meters max and reaching a depth of 2 meters. Anything caught halfway when the passage closes will get stuck, and travelers are unable to see or hear while passing through. Doorways resemble a watery patch on the wall, obstruction, etc, because of the loss of solidity, but are otherwise unobtrusive.
               <br><br>

               <b>Terrestrial Gate</b> [SUB-SKILL] - By visualizing a clear exit point, he can create doorways for traversing up to 10 km. If destination is insufficiently focused, he runs the risk of going "off-course", with the exit appearing somewhere less than ideal — ten stories off the ground, for instance. As such, he'll often mark locations with talismans. Up to one other person can follow him if they're touching him. Can be used once per thread, or twice a day.
            </blockquote>


            <b class="h6">Paths of Motion</b><br>
            <blockquote>
               <b>Divergence</b> [SUB-SKILL] - He can manipulate the directionality and speed of moving bodies and projectiles, including spells, within a 10 meter radius. Can only be applied to one target at time; the larger and more powerful it is, the lower his precision and ease of control.

               <br><br>

               <b>Flux</b> [SUB-SKILL] - Sacrificing control for scope, he can produce an aura with a radius of 11–40 meters. Projectiles released within this space behave erratically, whereas those fired <I>at</I> it from outside will be made to veer off-course as though subtly repelled. Lasts up to 4 posts (15 minutes). <b>Divergence</b> cannot be used while this is in effect.
            </blockquote>

            <b class="h6">Paths of the Spirit</b><br>
            <blockquote>
               <b>Pathfinder</b> [SUB-SKILL] - He can sense and visualize the reiryoku trails left by all living things. Those with more reiryoku leave behind stronger trails. Similarly, the more familiar he is with a persons' energy, the easier their trail is to follow.
               <br><br>

               <b>Turnkey</b> [SUB-SKILL] - He can seal a person's ability to access their reiryoku, rendering them temporarily incapable of magic. The effect lasts 3 posts (15 minutes) on those at a lower ascension level; 2 posts on those at an equal level; and 1 post on those higher. Requires physical contact.
            </blockquote>


            <b class="h6">Wayfarer's Blessings</b><br>
            <blockquote>
               <b>Wayfarer's Welcome</b> [SUB-SKILL] - Exerts a certain aura on people that makes them feel oddly compelled to be generous and respond positively to his requests. The effect is strongest with eye contact.

               <br><br>

               <b>Wayfarer's Rest</b> [SUB-SKILL] - He can give others a small energy buff, reinvigorating them, adding a lightness to their step. While the blessing won't heal them, it can lessen the pain of an injury, assuming it's not overly severe. Last 3 posts.

Frequently, sporadically, pleadingly, she writes — of your resemblance, of your magic, of old promises and other things you've stopped keeping track of, all in hopes he'll claim you son and provide everything she can't. No reply will ever come, only the odd gift like a bone for dog, and somehow that is worse.

Yokai are a distant threat when hunger's around the corner, so all the doors you open are ones that lead to jewels.
